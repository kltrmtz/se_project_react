# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

For this project an interactive weather app was built implementing the JavaScript library React. js, & designed using CSS. The current weather & location is pulled using an API request from a live site, to deliver accurate conditions. The application uses the collected data to produce recommended clothing items based off of the forecast. Users are able to create their own profile & add personalized clothing items.
